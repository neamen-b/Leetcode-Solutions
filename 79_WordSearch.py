Initial thoughts

a. DFS or BFS:
    Traverse and see if the chain has the given string?

b. Concatenate all the letters and use regex to find the target string ?
    Problem:
        1. how you concatenate the characters will affect the answer.
        2. Diffcult to check if the characters are adjacent
